# A-star-shortest-path-in-grid

This Java program implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path between the user-selected start cell (green) and destination cell (red) on a grid system. Users can also add obstacles to the grid by dragging the mouse, which will appear as black cells. Pressing the space key will display the shortest path in blue, while visited cells will be highlighted in yellow. 

The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding algorithm that calculates the shortest distance between two points while taking into account obstacles and other barriers. It does this by estimating the distance between the current position and the destination, and then choosing the next position with the lowest estimated distance. This process continues until the destination is reached, resulting in the shortest possible path.
